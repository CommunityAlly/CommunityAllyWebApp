        Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if  your jurisdiction has
        provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict  with the above
        then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by  law.

        liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence or that
        of  any of our officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent
        misrepresentation;  or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude
        either now or in the  future.
