    <h3 class="text-decoration-underline mt-5">Why</h3>
    <p>
        I <a href="https://gosimplelab.com/W7LLBJ/all-results" target="_blank">tested our water</a> and found certain high levels. A carbon filter can reduce the bromoform and bromodichloromethane that are a bit high in the SACWSD water. This
        will make your water taste better and be healthier for you. Our levels are still within the legal limits so this
        is just for folks that are interested in improving their water.
