        privacy, we may  elect to notify you, or we may attempt to quash the
        subpoena ourselves, but we  are not obligated to do either. You release us
        from any damages that may arise  from or relate to the release of your
        information to a request from law  enforcement agencies or private
        litigants. Community Ally Sites never sells or  shares user information. In

            There  are a few circumstances where Community Ally Sites may have to share
            information for compliance, or in the event of an audit, or lawsuit. While
            this  is unlikely, users will not hold Community Ally Sites liable for this.

        representations as to the security or privacy of your information. While we

        software,  firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from
        security threats.
    </p>

        Law. If you are a consumer with a California mailing address,  we will not
        share information we collect about you with companies outside of  Community

        with your consent, to service your accounts, or to provide rewards  or
        benefits to which you are entitled.
